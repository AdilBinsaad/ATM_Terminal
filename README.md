# Motivation
The motivation behind this project stems from the desire to understand and implement fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming and software engineering principles in a practical scenario. By building this ATM machine, I aimed to strengthen my skills in C# programming, data handling, and user interface design.

# Features Overview
Withdrawal: Users can withdraw cash from their account, with options for selecting different denominations.
Deposit: Users can deposit cash into their account, which gets reflected in their balance.
