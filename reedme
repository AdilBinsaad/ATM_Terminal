# ATM Machine Terminal Based
Description
This ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system is a console-based application implemented in C#. The primary goal of this project is to simulate the functionalities of a real-world ATM machine, providing users with a convenient way to perform banking transactions.

# Motivation
The motivation behind this project stems from the desire to understand and implement fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming and software engineering principles in a practical scenario. By building this ATM machine, I aimed to strengthen my skills in C# programming, data handling, and user interface design.
